## Plugin Overview

A WordPress plugin designed to elevate content authenticity. The plugin uses AI detection algorithms to predict whether a post‚Äôs content is generated by AI, human-written, or a combination of both. 

It detects whether a post is written by AI, a human, or a mix of both. If the content is fully AI-generated, the plugin automatically disables the Publish button to encourage genuine, human-created content.

This tool is perfect for content teams wanting to balance AI use with human input, keeping their posts authentic.

By implementing this plugin, organizations can confidently publish content with high transparency and integrity, setting a new benchmark for quality and trustworthiness in digital publishing.

The plugin includes an admin settings panel where the admin can set a threshold for AI content in posts. For instance, in the screenshot, the admin has set the threshold to 20%, so the plugin will allow posts with up to 20% AI content. If the AI content exceeds this limit, the Publish button will be disabled.

Currently, the plugin supports only the Gutenberg editor, but we‚Äôre working on extending compatibility to the TinyMCE editor as well.
